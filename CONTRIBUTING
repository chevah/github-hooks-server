Development
-----------

If starting with a clean repo, install virtualenv and dev requirements::

    make deps

Virtual environment is created in `build/` folder.::

    . build/bin/activate

Run tests::
    make test
    or
    nosetests


Manual starting
--------------

You can manually launch it on your dev system.
In this env it can't do many things as it needs access to Trac instance and
buildbot instance.

You will need a trac and a buildbot set up.
Create a `build/test_credentials` with the following details on each line:

* trac credentials
* buildbot address:port
* buildmaster PR account

To launch the server use:

    make run


Manual hook replay
------------------

In build/ folder create build/payload_headers and build/payload_content files
in which you can put the content based on the content that you find on
GitHub.com.

Trigger the payload push using::

    make payload
