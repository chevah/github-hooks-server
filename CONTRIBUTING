Development
-----------

If starting with a clean repo, install virtualenv and dev requirements::

    make deps

Virtual environment is created in `build/` folder.::

    . build/bin/activate

Run tests::
    make test
    or
    nosetests


Manual testing
--------------

Check the server launch, but you can not do to many things as it needs to be
fed with GitHub hooks and to connect to a Trac instance

For highscores, you will need to place a trac.db file in build/ so that it
will some something to work on.

To launch the server use:

    make run
